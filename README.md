## Features

The chrome extension itself is built with React using *https://github.com/segmentio/chrome-sidebar* and it only holds side bar function. Technically, the extension supports sidebar that provides iframe view of a page and function that imports image from menu. This implementation can be found in _./dist_ directory.

A single page application inside chrome extension supports main logic of functions for UI of Easy Diffuser. This implementation can be found in _./local_ directory.

The single page application is handled by server.py in _./local_ and supports GET (serves html) and POST (import image to the application) methods.

#### User Interface

![1686053693808](image/README/1686053693808.png)

This function is implemented by sending http POST request from chrome extension to page application. This implementation is in _./dist/main.js_ as below:

```javascript
sendToEasyDiffuser = async function (context) {
  var imageUrl = context.srcUrl;

  const Url = "http://127.0.0.1:9889";

  const response = await fetch(Url, {
    headers: {
      "content-type": "text/plain",
    },
    body: imageUrl,
    method: "POST",
  });

  return response.json();
};

chrome.contextMenus.create({
  title: "Easy Diffuser로 불러오기",
  contexts: ["image"], // ContextType
  onclick: sendToEasyDiffuser, // A callback function
});
```

**Choose a feature by selecting a radio button**

By selecting radio button, user can use either 'Image to Image' or 'Image to Tag' function. Checkbox under radio buttons enables filtering sexual contents when using functions, and it is set to be filtered by default.

## About Easy Diffuser

Easy Diffuser was developed to address the following issues:

1. Users spend a lot of time generating diffusion images.
2. Repeated generation of diffusion images consumes a lot of computing resources and power.
3. It is difficult to share the experience of the image generation process among users.

To solve these problems, Easy Diffuser provides the following two functions:

1. Extraction of generation conditions from a reference image:

   - Users can load a reference image and extract generation conditions. Easy Diffuser converts the input image into text using OpenAI's CLIP and translates it into tag combinations using a transformer-based translator. The resulting tag combinations can be used as inputs for `txt2img` in the WebUI.

2. Image-to-image generation using a reference image:

   - The existing image-to-image generation functionality requires users to go through steps such as finding, saving, and loading images, or using images generated with `txt2img`. Easy Diffuser provides a convenient menu to directly load images from web pages into the WebUI's `img2img` generation.
